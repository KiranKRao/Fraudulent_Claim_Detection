# Fraudulent Claim Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project aims to provide hands-on experience in model selection within real-world scenarios. You will learn to:

- Analyze and preprocess datasets
- Engineer meaningful features
- Apply a range of machine learning models to detect patterns and generate insights
- Evaluate and optimize model performance
- Compare approaches and select the most effective predictive solution

The objective of this project is to build reliable models that support accurate decision-making and ensure generalization across various applications.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Value

Building a predictive model for insurance fraud detection delivers significant value to businesses:

- **Current Challenges**: Fraud investigations often rely on manual processes such as claim reviews, claimant calls, and background checks. These are time-consuming and may delay fraud detection, while also slowing down the processing of legitimate claims.
- **Proposed Solution**: Predictive modeling enables early detection of high-risk claims, streamlining investigations and reducing financial losses.
- **Operational Benefits**: Improved efficiency, faster claim approvals for genuine customers, and better resource allocation.
- **Strategic Impact**: Enhances customer experience and increases overall profitability by enabling informed and timely decisions.

## ðŸ§  Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a classification model that can accurately label insurance claims as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, using historical data. The dataset includes features such as:

- Claim amount
- Customer profile
- Claim type
- Approval time

Using these variables, the model will predict the likelihood of fraud **before** claim approval, enabling early intervention and operational optimization.
